# Binary Yard

### Binary Yard's Home page

### installation of depende
```sh
$ npm install
```

### to publish the site on gh-pages branch
```sh
$ mkdir dist
$ npm run deploy
```
the codes in dist folder will be served as static page via (https://haibint.github.io/binaryyard/)

You then need to tell github to server this with your custom domain name.

Since I am learning to use postcss with tailwindcss, the codes in dist folder are managed manually for the time being.

### this page use tailwind css for styling
To see details of how to set up tailwind css, see (https://flaviocopes.com/tailwind-setup/)

tailwind.js is the configure file for tailwind css.
